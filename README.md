# 💎 express-boilerplate
this is my full-stack boilerplate currently it uses handlebars, objection.js + knex <br>it has two level routes one for pages that are rendered by handlebars and the second route is built for building restful web apps.

## 🐱‍🏍 Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/W2AlharbiMe/express-boilerplate.git`
- run `npm install` or `npm i`
- run `npm run dev:linux` to start the development server for linux users
- run `npm run dev:windows` to start the development server for windows users
- note: before using `yarn` remove `package-lock.json` since `yarn` uses `yarn.lock` file
